You are a graphic designer and you always feel upset of how many triangles you create 
in the project you work on, so you got an idea :thinking: to write a javascript function
that every time you call it, generates 3 values represent the angles of this triangle,
but you do not need any of these angels to be less than 30 degrees, your function should 
return every time 3 random values represent the angles, and of course you need sum of them 
to be 180 every time.

for Example

triangle(); // 60,40,80
triangle();// 70,30,80
triangle();// 56 77 47

//Solution 1



const triangle () {
  const firstAngle = Math.floor(Math.random() * (60 - 30 + 1)) + 30;
  const secondAngle = Math.floor(Math.random() * (90 - 30 + 1)) + 30;
  const third = 180 - (firstAngle + secondAngle) 
  return `${a},${b},${c}`;
}
