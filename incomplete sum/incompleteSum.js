/*
Incomplete sum
Write a function that takes an array of numbers as argument and return the sum of the largest and smallest numbers and all numbers in between except numbers found in the array

For example

getIncompleteSum([2,3,5])   // 11
getIncompleteSum([3,6,2,1,4]); // 12
getIncompleteSum([1,3,5,10]); //47


more explanation on te last example

the biggest number is 10, the smallest one is 1 , now we need to get the sum of 

10 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 47

3 and 5 not included because they exist in the array.
